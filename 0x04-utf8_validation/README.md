Task on UTF-8 Validation

I will be exploring the following concepts to complete the task:

1. Bitwise Operations in Python:
Understanding how to manipulate bits in Python, including operations like AND (&), OR (|), XOR (^), NOT (~), shifts (<<, >>).
Python Bitwise Operators.

2. UTF-8 Encoding Scheme:
Familiarity with the UTF-8 encoding rules, including how characters are encoded into one or more bytes.
Understanding the patterns that represent a valid UTF-8 encoded character.
UTF-8 Wikipedia
Characters, Symbols, and the Unicode Miracle
The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets.

3. Data Representation:
How to represent and work with data at the byte level.
Handling the least significant bits (LSB) of integers to simulate byte data.

4. List Manipulation in Python:
Iterating through lists, accessing list elements, and understanding list comprehensions.
Python Lists

5. Boolean Logic:
Applying logical operations to make decisions within the program.Task on UTF-8 Validation
